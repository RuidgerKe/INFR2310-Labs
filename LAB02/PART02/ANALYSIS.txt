● What causes the states to change? When do they change?
    Enemies:
      - Idle -> Seek
        Happens when the enemies have line of sight on the player character
        Changes with the same idea as the line above it
      - Seek -> Attack
        When the player character is in attack range of the enemy he changes into attack state
        It changes the momment the player character enters melee range
      - Anything -> Damage
        If the player character hits them within certain frames they will enter the damage state
        If the player uses a heavy attack the enemy is flung backwards
        It changes the momment their hitbox is connected with the player's hurtbox
● How does the state influence their movement?
    - They start off as idle/standing on the spot, but the moment they spot the character 
    - The attack animation roots them in place and slightly leans them forward before leaning back into their original state
