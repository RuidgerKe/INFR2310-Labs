How do they move? When do they move? Why do they move?
Mines - They are initially thrown from the boss as their own attack. They'll drop and bounce twice before stoping to a halt. 
When they stop to a halt, the player can hit them with the hat in order to knock it away in the same direction the hat has hit. 
The mines can hit the boss if the player lines it up properly. 

The Boss - The boss will slowly follow the character and throw a mine every so often. When the boss throws a mine, they will stop to "reload".
Once the boss gets hit by a mine reflected by the player, they will pause to play an animation and begin to run away from the player. 
Once the player jumps on their head, or the time to hit has elapsed, they will reset back to their agro state. 

Identify all of the different/unique behaviours/states the characters exhibit
Player:
- Jump 
- Throw Hat
- Ground Pound
- Halt
- Run

Boss:
- Walk 
- Throw Mine 
- Reload
- Hurt
- Reload Hat
- Running Away

What triggers the states to change?
Player - The player input change whatever happens on the screen of the action that the player is performing. 

Boss - The walk state is the original, as for their default they will walk towards the player. 
They will throw a mine after a couple seconds towards the player, so it is triggered by an internal timer. The reloading mine animation plays right after hte mine has been thrown. 
They will play their hurt animation after the player manages to hit them with the mine. This will follow with the running away animation until an internal timer reaches 0, or they player manages to jump on their head. 

How does the state influence their movement?
The boss originally will talk towards the player at a slow speed. When they need to reload they will halt in place to reload the mine in their hair. Once the player has removed their hat by hitting them with the mine, they will at first halt. Afterwards they will begin to run away from the player at a higher speed than her original walk speed.
