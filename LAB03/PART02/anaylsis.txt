How do they move? When do they move? Why do they move?
Mines - They are initially thrown from the boss as their own attack. They'll drop and bounce twice before stoping to a halt. 
When they stop to a halt, the player can hit them with the hat in order to knock it away in the same direction the hat has hit. 
The mines can hit the boss if the player lines it up properly.
