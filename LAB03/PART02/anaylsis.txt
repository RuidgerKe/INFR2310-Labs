How do they move? When do they move? Why do they move?
Mines - They are initially thrown from the boss as their own attack. They'll drop and bounce twice before stoping to a halt. 
When they stop to a halt, the player can hit them with the hat in order to knock it away in the same direction the hat has hit. 
The mines can hit the boss if the player lines it up properly. 

The Boss - The boss will slowly follow the character and throw a mine every so often. When the boss throws a mine, they will stop to "reload".
Once the boss gets hit by a mine reflected by the player, they will pause to play an animation and begin to run away from the player. 
Once the player jumps on their head, or the time to hit has elapsed, they will reset back to their agro state.
